# CS445-Artificial-Intelligence
Used Python in this class to create instances of AI's. Follows The UC Berkely AI class cirriculum

for these projects, it will work when you run the code with the script "python3 ____.py" ... If you change all the html's to cgi's, it won't run with python3,
but if you run the script "python _____.py" it will run. Just a matter of different python systems used.

Also, you will need to have X11 Forwarding enabled for both Pacman Projects (for GUI)

Project 1 (aiAutograder): Review
  - This was for us to familiarize ourselves with Python

Project 2 (aiPacman): Pacman Part 1
  - Developed an AI pacman that can move in Depth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, Breadth-First Search, and A* Heuristic Searching

Project 3 (multiagent): Pacman Part 2
  - Updated Pacman to Integrate multiagents within the game, and added in Minimax search, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and ExpectiMax search.

Project 4 (Project4): Test/Train Perceptrons
  - clean.py: takes a CSV that has information from a selected 600 college students, and cleans the data, and then creates a new csv with the cleaned data
  - predict.py: Does a 80% train, 20% test on the cleaned CSV, and makes a perceptron to predict more results. The prediction is stored in weights.txt (t threshold is first line, and then it goes to data)
